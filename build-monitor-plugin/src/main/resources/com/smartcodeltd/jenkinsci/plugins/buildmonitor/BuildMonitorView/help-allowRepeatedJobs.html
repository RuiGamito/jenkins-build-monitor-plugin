        Use this option if you want to force the dashboard to show repeated entries
        of the same job, if specified on the explicit order text box.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that enabling this will cause Build Monitor plugin to <strong>only show
        jobs that are explicitly listed and selected on the job filter</strong>,
        instead of having selected jobs (but unmentioned on the explicit order)
        being added to the bottom of the dashboard.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Please be aware that you'll need to enable this option (if you want
        to used it...) every time you edit open/save the configuration.</strong>
        This is a known, bug elusive bug, ATM...
